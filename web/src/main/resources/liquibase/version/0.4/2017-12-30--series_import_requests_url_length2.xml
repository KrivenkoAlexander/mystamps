			767 bytes is the maximum length for the index key prefix in MySQL 5.6 and prior versions.
			This limit was increased up to 3072 bytes in 5.7 version because innodb_large_prefix option
			was enabled by default and innodb_file_format was changed to use Barracuda by default.
			
			In other words, we can specify a value greater than 767 in production environment but
			I decided to use this value for now because we have a different MySQL 5.6.33 on TravisCI
			where migration fails to apply. I hope that this value will fulfill our requirements,
			because it's enough to hold about 255 non-ascii characters.
